# Happy Thoughts

Post happy thoughts and like other thoughts posted through an API.

## The problem

Used react and fetched data from API with both GET and POST request. Built the website with components for both all thoughts as well as the submit form. Had validation and disabled rules on input. If I had more time I would like to add loading animation and local storage to keep cunt of how many thoughts the user liked.
